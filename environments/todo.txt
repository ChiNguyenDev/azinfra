These are my personal notes for migrating the project into another account

1. make a terrafrom.tfvars file with the subscription id
2. make a "stateacc1999" storage account, "state" container
3. make a "testvault1999" key vault and these following secrets:
    	dbpassword
        vm1password
        vm2password
4. Create a group "DBAdmins", add yourself and change the objectid
